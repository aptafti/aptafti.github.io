	      <h2 class="featurette-heading">MSc Positions</h2>
	      <p>If you are already a MSc student at Pitt, and you would like to either do your Capstone Project with me or join my <a href="https://pitthexai.github.io/" target="_blank">Pitt HexAI Research Laboratory</a>, then please email me your CV and a brief description of your research interests.</p>
	      <p> If you are not at Pitt yet, and you are seeking funded MSc positions, then I would say I don't have funding opportunities for MSc students.</p>
	      
	      
              <h2 class="featurette-heading">PhD Positions</h2>
        
		<p>While I am always looking for self-motivated PhD students with strong command of AI and medical image analysis, I am recruiting PhD students basically from our graduate programs at the <a href="https://www.pitt.edu" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh</a>. Example includes <a href="https://www.isp.pitt.edu/academics/doctor-philosophy-intelligent-systems" target="_blank">Intelligent Systems Program</a>, <a href="https://www.shrs.pitt.edu/phdrs" target="_blank">SHRS</a>, <a href="https://www.sci.pitt.edu/academics/doctoral-degrees" target="_blank">School of Computing and Information</a>. Thus, you please email me after you get admitted at our graduate programs.</p>
		<p>When I was looking for PhD programs, I personally benefited a lot from this <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf" target="_blank">guideline</a> by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol" target="_blank">Prof. Mor Harchol-Balter</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.
	        <p>Interested applicants may also like to take a look at my research laboratory at the <a href="https://pitthexai.github.io/" target="_blank">Pitt HexAI Research Laboratory</a> to learn more about our research activities.</p>
	      
	      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Postdocs and Visiting Scholars</h2>
	      <p>If you are interested in joining my research laboratory as a postdoc or visiting scholar, please email me your CV, a letter of research interests, and funding sources for visiting scholar positions.</p>
	      <p> For your information, I am now receiving several emails in a weekly-basis. If you do not hear from me in a week, then that somehow means I decide not to move forward. I am really sorry! Also, all information/CV you send me will be kept private.</p>
	      <p>Interested applicants may also like to take a look at <a href="https://pitthexai.github.io/" target="_blank">Pitt HexAI Research Laboratory</a> to learn more about our research activities.</p>
	      
	      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Letters of Recommendation for Graduate School Applications</h2>
	      <p> I would be generally happy to write letters in support of applications for graduate schools, scholarships and fellowships, research programs, internships, and positions in academia and industry. Before listing me as a reference for any application, please make sure to contact me first to make sure that I can provide a letter for you.</p>
	      <p> Regarding applications for graduate programs, I need you to: (1) successfully completed a research project under my supervision, or (2) completed at least a course with me with a grade of A, or (3) helped as a TA in a course offered by me.</p>
