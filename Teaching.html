		       <li><em>"I had no idea about python but after taking Professor Tafti's Class my perception has changed completely. I love how he explains everything and makes things easy for us. I learned so much through this course and I loved it."</em> <small>-Anonymous, at the University of Pittsburgh</small></li>		     
   </br>
		      
		      <li><em>"Dear Professor Tafti, We were INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE to have had you as our instructor this semester. My professional ambition in life has been to provide tools to help healthcare professionals and the patients they serve. And thanks to the knowledge, guidance and inspiration you’ve provided, I’m hopeful and confident that leveraging meaningful AI can be a part of that journey. Thank you so much for all you did this last semester. It was the best class I’ve ever had throughout both my undergrad and MBA and you were by far the best Professor I’ve ever had. 
"</em> <small>-Jamie Gramz, Head of Digital Applications at Siemens Healthineers</small></li>		     
   </br>

		      <li><em>"The most helpful aspect of this course was a mixture of both Dr. Tafti's excellent teaching method through using Google Colab and the fact that most of the assignments directly corresponded to the material covered in class. This meant that, as long as you actively
participated in class and took notes, the assignments were a breeze. This combination GREATLY helped me get introduced and involved with Python, and I am very appreciative of Dr. Tafti (and the TA's) for that!"</em> <small>-Anonymous, at the University of Pittsburgh</small></li>		     
   </br>
		      
		     
	      <li><em>"Hi Dr. Tafti, I am very pleased to be able to be your student. It is a true pleasure for me to meet such a serious and responsible teacher as yourself. I have enjoyed taking your class. Your explanations of all knowledge points are very thorough. You have a very serious and responsible attitude towards student, and I really appreciate that. Thank you for making learning not a dull thing but a great joy!
"</em> <small>-Anonymous, at the University of Pittsburgh</small></li>		     
   </br>

		      <li><em>"This course was the best course of my entire curriculum at the University of Pittsburgh due to the topics presented and the practical applications within assignments. There was not a single moment where I felt that I was bored because of the effort the instructors made in communicating difficult topics in deep learning to the students.

  <li><em>"While pursuing my computer science degree at the University of Southern Maine, I was fortunate to have Ahmad Tafti as a professor for my Software Engineering and my Database Systems classes. Professor Tafti was extremely knowledgeable in the subject matter. He was always willing to help if I needed it and truly seemed to care about the progress I was making. Through his teaching not only did I learn the coursework, but I was exposed to some of the cutting-edge AI and Data Science research that was taking place. The strongest quality that stands out about Ahmad as an instructor is that he has a genuine passion for the subject matter, and this always made his classes enjoyable to attend."</em> <small>-Debbie Hindley, Associate Software Support Specialist at Tyler Technologies</small></li>		     
   </br>
		      
		      <li><em>"I had the fortunate opportunity of being able to learn from Ahmad while studying computer science at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. Ahmad has a wide range of knowledge in topics including, but not limited to, Java, web development, and software engineering.  In addition to his extensive knowledge, Ahmad is very approachable, listens well, and explains things well." </em><small>-Ilan Hirschman, Software Engineer 3 at Entegral</small></li>
		      </br>		      
  <li><em>"Prof. Tafti was always enthusiastic and ready to answer questions and clarify doubts, responding very quickly to questions. The video lectures were very pleasant to watch, the material was presented in a very clear way and it was really easy to follow. It is clear that Prof. Tafti put a lot of effort into this course!." </em><small>-Rafael Bergo, Software Developer at Arbeit</small></li>
	      </br>
	    <li><em>"I had a pleasure of being one of Ahmad's students at University of Southern Maine. As a professor, Ahmad encouraged deep understanding of concepts and ensured that no student is left behind. He promoted modern topics in Computer Science and recruited students to his AI lab. I particularly enjoyed that Ahmad always recognized an extra effort and encouraged students to explore topics beyond those covered in class. I am grateful to be one of his students." </em><small>-Aleksandra Milinovic, Computer Science Student at USM</small></li>
	    </br>
	    <li><em>"Dr. Tafti provided me exceptional guidance throughout my academic career and assisted me with gaining relevant experience in my field of study, especially computer vision. He also provided me multiple opportunities to put the skills I learned in his classes into real world practice. This was very helpful for me in advancing my professional career. Dr. Tafti has been supportive throughout my academic career and even beyond to now. I have always looked forward to working with him." </em><small>-Tomomi Bahun, Software Developer at Tyler Technologies</small></li>
	    </br>
	  <li><em>"Dr. Tafti is very knowledgeable. Furthermore, it is clear that he cares about his students' success, edification and well–being. I look forward to learning from and working with him further."</em> <small>-Louie Coyle, Computer Science Student at USM<small></li>
