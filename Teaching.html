	      <ul>
  <li><em>"I had the fortunate opportunity of being able to learn from Ahmad while studying computer science at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. Ahmad has a wide range of knowledge in topics including, but not limited to, Java, web development, and software engineering.  In addition to his extensive knowledge, Ahmad is very approachable, listens well, and explains things well." </em>-Ilan Hirschman, Software Engineer 3 at Entegral</li>
		      </br>		      
  <li><em>"Prof. Tafti was always enthusiastic and ready to answer questions and clarify doubts, responding very quickly to questions. The video lectures were very pleasant to watch, the material was presented in a very clear way and it was really easy to follow. It is clear that Prof. Tafti put a lot of effort into this course!." </em>-Rafael Bergo, Software Developer at Arbeit</li>
	      </br>
	    <li><em>"I had a pleasure of being one of Ahmad's students at University of Southern Maine. As a professor, Ahmad encouraged deep understanding of concepts and ensured that no student is left behind. He promoted modern topics in Computer Science and recruited students to his AI lab. I particularly enjoyed that Ahmad always recognized an extra effort and encouraged students to explore topics beyond those covered in class. I am grateful to be one of his students." </em>-Aleksandra Milinovic, Computer Science Student at USM</li>
	    </br>
	    <li><em>"Dr. Tafti provided me exceptional guidance throughout my academic career and assisted me with gaining relevant experience in my field of study, especially computer vision. He also provided me multiple opportunities to put the skills I learned in his classes into real world practice. This was very helpful for me in advancing my professional career. Dr. Tafti has been supportive throughout my academic career and even beyond to now. I have always looked forward to working with him." </em>-Tomomi Bahun, Software Developer at Tyler Technologies</li>
	    </br>
	  <li><em>"Dr. Tafti is very knowledgeable. Furthermore, it is clear that he cares about his students' success, edification and wellâ€“being. I look forward to learning from and working with him further."</em> -Louie Coyle, Computer Science Student at USM</li>
