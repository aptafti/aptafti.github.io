<p>Ahmad P. Tafti is an Assistant Professor of Health Informatics in the <a href="https://www.shrs.pitt.edu/him" target="_blank">Department of Health Information Management</a> within the <a href="https://www.shrs.pitt.edu/" target="_blank">School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.pitt.edu/" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh</a>, where he is leading the <a href="https://pitthexai.github.io" target="_blank">Pitt HexAI Research Laboratory</a>. Starting from August 2022, he serves our community as the Vice Chair of <a href="https://www.computer.org/" target="_blank">IEEE Computer Society</a> at Pittsburgh.​</p>
<p>He is working with multidisciplinary team of faculty members, students, and investigators to design, build, validate, and deploy “explainable” artificial intelligence (AI) components in different healthcare domains, mainly in orthopedic setting, musculoskeletal disorders and diseases, and pain management. Ahmad P. Tafti's research laboratory aims to make the healthcare better through the power of “explainable” AI. His research focuses on engineering, implementing, validating, and deploying cutting-edge fundamental and applied AI algorithms, and mainly promote their applications in healthcare problems. Ahmad P. Tafti's team are passionate for improving healthcare by better patient diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment using the power of advanced AI and machine learning algorithms combined with diverse and larg-columns of clinical data (e.g., medical images, clinical notes, radiology reports, patient-provided information, and electronic health records).​</p>
