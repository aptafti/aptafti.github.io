<p>I am an Assistant Professor of Health Informatics in the <a href="https://www.shrs.pitt.edu/him" target="_blank">Department of Health Information Management</a> within the <a href="https://www.shrs.pitt.edu/" target="_blank">School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.pitt.edu/" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh</a>, where I am also leading our efforts at the <a href="https://pitthexai.github.io" target="_blank">Pitt HexAI Research Laboratory</a>. Starting from August 2022, I am honored to serve our community as the Vice Chair of <a href="https://www.computer.org/" target="_blank">IEEE Computer Society</a> at Pittsburgh.​</p>
<p>I am working with multidisciplinary team of faculty members, students, and investigators to design, build, validate, and deploy “explainable” artificial intelligence (AI) components in different healthcare domains, mainly in orthopedic setting, musculoskeletal disorders and diseases, and pain management. My research laboratory aims to make the healthcare better through the power of “explainable” AI. Our research focuses on engineering, implementing, validating, and deploying cutting-edge fundamental and applied AI algorithms, and mainly promote their applications in healthcare problems. My team and I are passionate for improving healthcare by better patient diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment using the power of advanced AI and machine learning algorithms combined with diverse and larg-columns of clinical data (e.g., medical images, clinical notes, radiology reports, patient-provided information, and electronic health records).​</p>
<p>I earned my BSc, MSc, and PhD all in Computer Science, with a focus on AI, computer vision, and machine learning/deep learning computational components, and since then, I have been on a quest to explore and solve problems that are “worth it” and have the most positive impact on people's lives. I have solid background in computer science, with an extensive research experience in AI-Enabled descriptive and predictive modeling, autonomous image and text analytics and interpretation, and big data processing to find solutions to a diverse set of problems in healthcare, ranging from 3D-2D medical image analysis to objectively and automatically predicting clinical outcomes and scientific visualization, as it has been already illustrated by my publication records.​</p>

</p>
<p>I take an active interest in mentoring and teaching students, as it has been an important part of my appointments at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (as a TA), at the University of Southern Maine, and now at the University of Pittsburgh. I have had substantial teaching experience in several undergraduate and graduate level courses. Examples include Introduction to Python for Health Informatics, Algorithms in Programming, Introduction to Database Systems, Capstone Projects, and Computer Vision.</p>
